# 🧠 A to Z Project Flow — Personal UPI Usage & Financial Analyzer (Theory Only)

---

## 📌 **1. Overview / Problem Understanding**

> Build an AI-powered personal finance app that:

* Takes **UPI transaction PDFs** from Paytm, GPay, PhonePe
* **Extracts & cleans data**
* **Analyzes** financial habits
* Uses **LLMs** to provide **personalized savings suggestions**
* Provides an **interactive user interface**

---

## ⚙️ **2. Environment Setup**

> Prepare the environment to support extraction, analysis, LLM, and UI

* ✅ Install Python 3.10+ and tools like VS Code or Jupyter
* ✅ Create and activate a virtual environment
* ✅ Install libraries like:

  * `pdfplumber`, `pandas`, `openai`, `streamlit`, `matplotlib`, `langchain`, `seaborn`, `tqdm`
* ✅ Create a GitHub repo for version control and public hosting

---

## 🗂️ **3. Folder Structure**

> Organize files and modules to keep project clean

```
upi-financial-analyzer/
├── data/               # Raw UPI PDFs
├── extracted/          # Parsed CSV/JSON data
├── output/             # Final analysis reports (optional)
├── src/                # Core code modules
├── app/                # Streamlit/Gradio frontend
├── assets/             # Images, logos, plots
├── notebooks/          # EDA, prototype scripts
├── requirements.txt    # Dependencies
└── README.md           # Project overview and guide
```

## 📥 **4. Collect Sample UPI Statements**

> Gather real or mock PDF transaction statements from:

* Paytm: Profile → Statements → Download
* GPay: Search emails for statements
* PhonePe: History → Export report
* Place files into `data/`

---

## 📄 **5. PDF Parsing Strategy**

> Read and extract tables or lines from PDFs

* Use `pdfplumber` or `PyMuPDF` to open and read PDF pages
* For each app, understand the format (table-based vs. line-based)
* Build separate extractors for each app if needed
* Output structured rows: `Date`, `Time`, `Amount`, `Merchant`, `Description`, `Transaction Type`
* Save to `extracted/filename.csv`

---

## 🧼 **6. Data Cleaning & Structuring**

> Convert messy raw text to clean tabular data

* Normalize date format (`DD-MM-YYYY`)
* Convert amount strings (₹, commas) to float
* Separate merged columns (e.g., “Merchant - Note”)
* Drop empty or irrelevant rows
* Create final clean DataFrame
* Save as CSV for analysis

---

## 🏷️ **7. Categorization / Tagging (Optional)**

> Group expenses into logical categories

* Build a dictionary mapping keywords to categories:

  ```python
  {"Zomato": "Food", "Uber": "Travel", "IRCTC": "Travel", "Flipkart": "Shopping"}
  ```
* Apply tags based on merchant/description fields
* Add new column: `Category`

---

## 📊 **8. Financial Data Analysis**

> Analyze the cleaned data using Pandas

* Total amount spent in the month
* Daily/weekly/monthly summaries
* Spending per category
* Frequent merchants
* Detect wasteful transactions (e.g., similar spends repeatedly)
* Optional: Generate plots (bar, pie charts)

---

## 🤖 **9. LLM Integration Planning**

> Let LLMs analyze behavior and give recommendations

* Structure prompt like:

  ```
  Here is a summary of user’s UPI spending data (JSON format).
  Generate:
  - Spending summary
  - Suggestions to reduce costs
  - Budgeting advice
  ```
* Decide which LLM to use:

  * GPT-3.5 (via OpenAI API)
  * Open-source model via Hugging Face

---

## 🔁 **10. Langchain / Langflow Setup**

> Use Langflow or Langchain for modular LLM pipelines

* Chain input (data) → prompt → response formatting
* Optional: Set up memory, multi-step LLM chains
* Make the logic repeatable and testable

---

## 🖼️ **11. User Interface (Streamlit / Gradio)**

> Build a simple frontend for users

* Allow PDF upload
* Show extracted transactions as table
* Show analysis: Total spend, Top 5 categories, etc.
* Ask LLM questions like:

  * "Where did I spend most this month?"
  * "How to reduce my spending?"
* Output LLM responses live

---

## ☁️ **12. Deployment**

> Host your working app on a public platform

* Use **Hugging Face Spaces**:

  * Add `app.py`, `requirements.txt`
  * Push to Hugging Face repo → Get a public link
* Or use **Replit**, **Render**, or **Streamlit Cloud** for free hosting

---

## 📋 **13. Documentation & Demo**

> Prepare to showcase your work

* `README.md` with:

  * Project overview
  * How to run the app locally
  * Sample screenshots
* Create a **video walkthrough** using Loom or OBS
* Optional: Make a slide deck if showcasing to companies
